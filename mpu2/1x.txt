A = MN
D = A = MN
A = KL
HL = 0000H
C = 04H is the counter for loop
set carry flag 1
complement carry flag to make it 0
Rotate A left so that D7 comes to Carry flag and carry flag = 0 comes to D0
E = A
A = 00H
A = Carry Flag
H will store NK
to check if C was 1 or not next

Rotate A left so that next bit from KL can be put in D0 of NK
restore C after testing
H = A
A = D
Carry flag = 1
complement carry flag to make it 0
Rotate A left so that D7 comes to Carry flag and carry flag = 0 comes to D0
D = A
A = 00H
A = Carry Flag
L will store LM
to check if C was 1 or not next

Rotate A left so that next bit from MN can be put in D0 of LM
L = A
E = A
